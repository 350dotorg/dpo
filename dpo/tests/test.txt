    >>> import polib
    >>> source = polib.pofile("dpo/tests/test.po")
    >>> new = dpo.new_locale(source)

If the source file entry contains a `msgstr`, it is considered the "source text"
and reproduced exactly in the output entry's `msgstr` and translator comments.
Extracted comments are preserved in the output.

    >>> print source[0]
    #. Exhaustive user testing demonstrated that in our installation of the 
    #. software, 
    #. account creation took between 20-55 seconds, so we had to change this
    #. string 
    #. to avoid lawsuits from disgruntled users.
    #: utils.py:77
    msgid ""
    "You need to create an account first. Don't worry -- it only takes 15 "
    "seconds!"
    msgstr ""
    "You need to create an account first. Don't worry -- it takes less than a "
    "minute!"
    <BLANKLINE>
    >>> print new[0]
    # ;; Source text ;;
    # msgstr ""
    # "You need to create an account first. Don't worry -- it takes less than a "
    # "minute!"
    # ;;

If the source text contained plural forms, these will all be reproduced exactly
in the output's `msgstr` and comments:

    >>> print new[-1]
    # ;; Source text ;;
    # msgstr[0] ""
    # "\n"
    # "    Showing %(num_actions)s project\n"
    # "  "
    # msgstr[1] ""
    # "\n"
    # "    Showing %(num_actions)s projects\n"
    # "  "
    # ;;
    #: templates/action.html:50
    #, python-format
    msgid ""
    "\n"
    "    Showing %(num_actions)s action\n"
    "  "
    msgid_plural ""
    "\n"
    "    Showing %(num_actions)s actions\n"
    "  "
    msgstr[0] ""
    "\n"
    "    Showing %(num_actions)s project\n"
    "  "
    msgstr[1] ""
    "\n"
    "    Showing %(num_actions)s projects\n"
    "  "
    <BLANKLINE>
    
If no source text is present, the output entry will have a `msgstr` that is copied
directly from the `msgid`.  This is because translators do not need to care whether
the source text is overridden or not -- they just need to translate the source text
wherever it came from.  So this way, they can always look in the same place for the
source text.  Similarly, the output entry will have the source text reproduced in
the comment, with an additional indicator that the source text was the `msgid`.

    >>> print new[2]
    # ;; Source text ;;
    # msgid ""
    # "\n"
    # "%(SITE_NAME)s Contents\n"
    # ;;
    #: templates/home.html:15
    #, python-format
    msgid ""
    "\n"
    "%(SITE_NAME)s Contents\n"
    msgstr ""
    "\n"
    "%(SITE_NAME)s Contents\n"

It will work for plurals, too:

    >>> print new[-2]
    # ;; Source text ;;
    # msgid ""
    # "\n"
    # "\t\t  %(days_till_event)s day remaining\n"
    # "\t\t  "
    # msgid_plural ""
    # "\n"
    # "\t\t  %(days_till_event)s days remaining\n"
    # "\t\t  "
    # ;;
    #: templates/calendar.html:26
    #, python-format
    msgid ""
    "\n"
    "\t\t  %(days_till_event)s day remaining\n"
    "\t\t  "
    msgid_plural ""
    "\n"
    "\t\t  %(days_till_event)s days remaining\n"
    "\t\t  "
    msgstr[0] ""
    "\n"
    "\t\t  %(days_till_event)s day remaining\n"
    "\t\t  "
    msgstr[1] ""
    "\n"
    "\t\t  %(days_till_event)s days remaining\n"
    "\t\t  "
    <BLANKLINE>

Translators now have a PO file that they can work with.  

    >>> import tempfile
    >>> fd, path = tempfile.mkstemp(prefix="--dpo--doctest--", suffix=".po")
    >>> new.save(path)
    >>> pofile = polib.pofile(path)
    >>> pofile[0].msgstr = u"Sie m체ssen zun채chst ein Konto erstellen. Keine Sorge - es dauert weniger als eine Minute!"
    >>> pofile[1].msgstr = u"Anfang"
    >>> pofile[-1].msgstr_plural['1'] = "Revealing %(num_action)s items"
    >>> pofile[-2].msgstr_plural['0'] = "Today's the big day of the event!"

If the translator edits a msgstr, it will be considered the new
translation. If the translator does not edit a msgstr, dpo can detect
this and strip the source text back out of the PO file when it
reenters the dpo system.

    >>> pofile.save(path)
    >>> pofile = polib.pofile(path)
    
    >>> new = dpo.submit_locale(pofile)
    >>> print new[0].msgstr
    Sie m체ssen zun채chst ein Konto erstellen. Keine Sorge - es dauert weniger als eine Minute!
    >>> print new[1].msgstr
    Anfang
    >>> print new[3].msgstr
    <BLANKLINE>

The same logic should work for entries with plural forms:

    >>> print new[-1]
    # ;; Source text ;;
    # msgstr[0] ""
    # "\n"
    # "    Showing %(num_actions)s project\n"
    # "  "
    # msgstr[1] ""
    # "\n"
    # "    Showing %(num_actions)s projects\n"
    # "  "
    # ;;
    #: templates/action.html:50
    #, python-format
    msgid ""
    "\n"
    "    Showing %(num_actions)s action\n"
    "  "
    msgid_plural ""
    "\n"
    "    Showing %(num_actions)s actions\n"
    "  "
    msgstr[0] ""
    msgstr[1] "Revealing %(num_action)s items"

    >>> print new[-2]
    # ;; Source text ;;
    # msgid ""
    # "\n"
    # "\t\t  %(days_till_event)s day remaining\n"
    # "\t\t  "
    # msgid_plural ""
    # "\n"
    # "\t\t  %(days_till_event)s days remaining\n"
    # "\t\t  "
    # ;;
    #: templates/calendar.html:26
    #, python-format
    msgid ""
    "\n"
    "\t\t  %(days_till_event)s day remaining\n"
    "\t\t  "
    msgid_plural ""
    "\n"
    "\t\t  %(days_till_event)s days remaining\n"
    "\t\t  "
    msgstr[0] "Today's the big day of the event!"
    msgstr[1] ""
    <BLANKLINE>

    >>> import os
    >>> os.unlink(path)
